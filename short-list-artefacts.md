# Artefacts for Keywork, 'history'

(ha, bit of a slip there. should be 'keywords', but I like the word, 'keywork')

Of course, lots of my artefacts are not necessarily built by card-carrying historians. I suspect that doesn't matter, right? Anyway...

## What's Wrong with Writing Essays?

+ Artifact Type: description of an assignment that imagines 'writing' to be more akin to 'making'

This piece crystalizes the issue around essays: we are too much concerned with 'form' and forgetting about 'content'. Sample points out that 'text' derives from the Latin 'to weave', and uses that metaphor to suggest expanding the range of possibilities. Accordingly, Sample offers an example of an assignment designed to 'take the words out of writing', a prompt to create an 'abstract mapping' of a videogame's underlying complexity and representation of the world. A similar prompt could be devised for domains beyond the representation of history in videogames, for instance, the organization of an archival fonds.

## The Unessay

This piece similarly documents problems with 'essays' as they have come to be in the modern undergraduate classroom. What's more, it provides a framework for re-situating them as digital pedagogy, returning agency to the student, and an entirely useful set of criteria for assessing work that does not look like traditional forms. The criteria provided can be transformed into a rubric with two criteria, that the work is 'compelling' and 'effective'.

## Open Notebook History
![img](/img/history-wcalebmcdaniel-wiki-screenshot.png)
+ Artifact Type: blog reflection
+ Source Url: http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html
+ Artefact Permissions: CC BY-SA 3.0
+ Creator and Affiliation: W. Caleb McDaniel, Rice University
McDaniel opens a dialogue with proponents of so-called 'open notebook science', and situates it within practices familiar to historians (a process similar to what Chad Black has called, ['Hacking the Papers of You'](https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-individual-research-archive-hacking-the-papers-of-you/)). McDaniel argues that we cannot know the full value of what we have until we allow others to see it; if we did so, while the work was in progress, "we also open new avenues of interpretation, uncover new linkages between things we would otherwise have persisted in seeing as unconnected, and create new opportunities for collaboration with fellow travelers." He outlines the use of Gitit, a personal wiki program combined with Git versioning control, for maintaining such a notebook. Gitit has a steep learning curve; others might want to use a combination of text editor and github repository to achieve the same effect.

## Writing in Public
![img](/img/history-moravec-writinginpublic.png)
+ Artifact Type: web page
+ Source Url: http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/
+ Artefact Permissions: no license provided
+ Creator and Affiliation: Michelle Moravec, Rosemont College
  This page is a landing page for Moravec's writing projects; her goal in writing in public is to demystify the processes of academic labour. She situates this goal within her research on women's liberation movements, as part of a tradition of work that breaks down the boundaries between public and private 'to reveal the politics underneath'. Moravec provides links to projects in progress, and projects completed. She uses a combination of google docs, twitter hashtags, and curated shortlinks to keep track of her readers' engagement with her work.

## Who do you think you are?
![img](/img/history-cottom-who-do-you-think-you-are.png)
+ Artefact Type: journal article
+ Source Url: http://adanewmedia.org/2015/04/issue7-mcmillancottom/
+ Artefact Permissions: CC BY-SA 4.0
+ Creator and Affiliation: Tressie McMillan Cottom, Virginia Commonwealth University
It can be dangerous when we break down the walls of our teaching and research, and expose these processes to the wider world. In "Who do you think you are?", Tressie McMillan Cottom analyzes the sociology of the performative attention economy of online work. She exposes the ways that if you don't look like a white man onine, what can or cannot be done in terms of a public-facing digital work becomes much more complicated and  dangerous. The piece serves as a counterbalance to the artefacts discussed above.

## Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology (DAEA)
![img](/img/history-anthro-class-msu-daea.png)
+ Artefact Type: class project
+ Source Url: https://matrix-msu.github.io/daea/ (Source code at [https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea](https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea))
+ Artefact Permissions: No license provided
+ Creator and Affiliation: Students in the Fall 2014 semester in the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt class (ANP 455) at Michigan State University, led by Ethan Watrall and supported by Brian Geyer.
The DAEA as a work of collaborative scholarship exemplifies many of the ideas that the previous artefacts point towards. Moreover, the act of putting the source code online allows this student scholarship to be leveraged by other students, expanded, and transmogrified. Christina Ross forked this and repurposed it to become a microhistory of St. John's, Newfoundland http://xtina-r.github.io/daea/, which was then repurposed and extended by Rob Blades (in progress: http://pembrokesoundscapes.ca). Ross's version is on the syllabus in Jeffery McClurken's 'Adventures in Digital History'. http://courses.mcclurken.org/adh/syllabus/). The DAEA shows ways that student work can have impact beyond the classroom.

## The HeritageJam
Andrew Masinton, Sarah Perry, Tara Copplestone, Izzy Bartley http://heritagejam.org. An annual two-day event, having just gone through its second iteration, where participants collaborate to make something along a particular theme, from a particular collection, with a decidedly public-facing inflection. Aside from the wonderful things participants make, the Jam rules require them to document the _paradata_ that supports the work. The paradata document draws on a long history in archaeological research of visualizations and making (there is an entire subfield, 'experimental archaeology', which has strong affinities to digital humanities pedagogy and deformance) as codified in the 2009 London Charter of Heritage Visualization (http://www.londoncharter.org/) . Paradata "provide the space through which we communicate ambiguity and transparency, and account for our practices. In explicitly detailing the creator's process, paradata enable openness, making visible the "relationship between research sources, implicit knowledge, explicit reasoning, and visualisation-based outcomes." This offers viewers an insight into the making process, and an opportunity to think critically about how our images are constructed and create meaning about the past."

## TEI Close Reading Exercise
+ TEI Close Reading exercise by Melodee Beals https://github.com/mhbeals/TEI-Close-Reading demonstrates not just exposing research or teaching to the world, but also builds capacity for the rest of us by sharing the materials.

## Every Three Minutes
+ Every Three Minutes https://twitter.com/every3minutes, associated post, http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/slave-sales-on-twitter.html Caleb McDaniel. Our teaching and research, when freed from the confines of an essay, can become a 'bot of conviction' ([Mark Sample]( https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa#.k7zhd3p6e) that directly confronts the public with the past; the affordances of the medium are used to devastating effect.

## The Programming Historian, issue #152
+ Finally, [The Programming Historian team](http://programminghistorian.org) too, especially this conversation thread, '[how can we make the PH more friendly for women to contribute?'](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/152). This thread and the thoughtful discussion that surrounds it shows a community of practice around digital pedagogy and capacity building wrestling with an issue in a way that is collegial, humble, and open. At the end of the thread, the discussion will continue with a workshop <https://digitalhistorymentorship.wordpress.com/>.

Digital pedagogy in history changes not just how we teach, but how we _do_, history - how we work on our own, with colleagues, with students, and with the public. All of these pieces are essays in the sense of _essayer_ to try, to experiment, to change the world a little bit.

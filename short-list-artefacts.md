# Artefacts for Keywork, 'history'

(ha, bit of a slip there. should be 'keywords', but I like the word, 'keywork')

Of course, lots of my artefacts are not necessarily built by card-carrying historians. I suspect that doesn't matter, right? Anyway...

## What's Wrong with Writing Essays? Mark Sample. Appears in a couple of different

This piece crystalizes the issue around essays: we are too much concerned with 'form' and forgetting about 'content', moreover, that 'writing' could mean something far more expansive. The 'textus' bit really struck me back when I first started at Carleton (when I had to learn how to be an academic all over again). No license on the blog post, but the other versions...



**Ian comment: your "first started at Carleton and having to learn all around" is interesting and calls out for a bit more context for those who don't know your cool story!**

+ The Unessay Daniel Paul O'Donnell http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay  This piece similarly documents problems with 'essays' as they have come to be. What's more, it provides a framework for re-situating them as digital pedagogy, returning agency to the student, and an entirely operationalizeable (if that's a word) set of criteria for assessing work that does not look like traditional forms.

+ The HeritageJam Andrew Masinton, Sarah Perry, Tara Copplestone, Izzy Bartley http://heritagejam.org. An annual two-day event, having just gone through its second iteration, where participants collaborate to make something along a particular theme, from a particular collection, with a decidedly public-facing inflection. Aside from the wonderful things participants make, the Jam rules require them to document the _paradata_ that supports the work. The paradata document draws on a long history in archaeological research of visualizations and making (there is an entire subfield, 'experimental archaeology', which has strong affinities to digital humanities pedagogy and deformance) as codified in the 2009 London Charter of Heritage Visualization (http://www.londoncharter.org/) . Paradata "provide the space through which we communicate ambiguity and transparency, and account for our practices. In explicitly detailing the creator's process, paradata enable openness, making visible the "relationship between research sources, implicit knowledge, explicit reasoning, and visualisation-based outcomes." This offers viewers an insight into the making process, and an opportunity to think critically about how our images are constructed and create meaning about the past."
+ Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology - "Collaboratively produced [...] in the Fall 2014 semester by the students registered in the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt class (ANP 455), the Digital Atlas of Ancient Egypt represents an experiment in applied digital archaeology undergraduate learning." Led by Ethan Watrall. The act of putting this online allows student work to be leveraged by other students, expanded, transmogrified. Christina Ross forked this and repurposed it to become a microhistory of St. John's, Newfoundland http://xtina-r.github.io/daea/, which was then repurposed and extended by Rob Blades (in progress: pembrokesoundscapes.ca). Ross's version is on the syllabus in Jeffery McClurken's 'Adventures in Digital History'. http://courses.mcclurken.org/adh/syllabus/ ).
+ Not just teaching, but also our research: Chad Black's "Hacking the Papers of You" https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-individual-research-archive-hacking-the-papers-of-you/ **Ian: A bit more here as with the other ones?**
+ TEI Close Reading exxercise by Melodee Beals https://github.com/mhbeals/TEI-Close-Reading demonstrates not just exposing research or teaching to the world, but also builds capacity for the rest of us by sharing the materials.
+ Bethany Nowviskie, 2.5 cheers for lunatics http://nowviskie.org/2012/lunaticks/ Bethany's impact in DH more generally is so huge, and I've always appreciated her work for how it expands the possibility spaces. Here, she makes the argument about the importance of this work in terms of laying the groundwork for what comes next.
+ It can be dangerous when we break down the walls of our teaching and research, and expose these processes to the wider world. "Who do you think you are?" by Tressie McMillan Cottom http://adanewmedia.org/2015/04/issue7-mcmillancottom/ is required reading. If you don't look like a white man, what can or cannot be done in terms of a public-facing digital pedagogy becomes much more complicated and sometimes dangerous.
+ Every Three Minutes https://twitter.com/every3minutes, associated post, http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/slave-sales-on-twitter.html Caleb McDaniel. Our teaching and research, when freed from the confines of an essay, can become a 'bot of conviction' ([Mark Sample]( https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa#.k7zhd3p6e) that directly confronts the public with the past; the affordances of the medium are used to devastating effect.
+ Finally, [The Programming Historian team](http://programminghistorian.org) too, especially this conversation thread, '[how can we make the PH more friendly for women to contribute?'](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/152). This thread and the thoughtful discussion that surrounds it shows a community of practice around digital pedagogy and capacity building wrestling with an issue in a way that is collegial, humble, and open. At the end of the thread, the discussion will continue with a workshop <https://digitalhistorymentorship.wordpress.com/>.

Digital pedagogy in history changes not just how we teach, but how we _do_, history - how we work on our own, with colleagues, with students, and with the public. All of these pieces are essays in the sense of _essayer_ to try, to experiment, to change the world a little bit.

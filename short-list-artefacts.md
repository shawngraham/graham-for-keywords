# Artefacts for Keywork, 'history'

(ha, bit of a slip there. should be 'keywords', but I like the word, 'keywork')

Of course, lots of my artefacts are not necessarily built by card-carrying historians. I suspect that doesn't matter, right? Anyway...

## What's Wrong with Writing Essays? Mark Sample. Appears in a couple of different
![img](/img/history-MarkSample-wrong-with-essays.png)
+ Artifact Type: description of an assignment that imagines 'writing' to be more akin to 'making'
+ Source URL:http://www.samplereality.com/2009/03/12/whats-wrong-with-writing-essays/
+ Artifact Permissions: no license appears
Copy of the Artifact (in HTML, PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, RTF, MP3, MP4, MOV, PNG, or JPG), if possible
+ Creator and Affiliation: Mark Sample, Davidson College

This piece crystalizes the issue around essays: we are too much concerned with 'form' and forgetting about 'content', moreover, that 'writing' could mean something far more expansive. Sample offers an example of an assignment designed to 'take the words out of writing'.

## The Unessay

+ Artifact Type: assignment prompt

This piece similarly documents problems with 'essays' as they have come to be in the modern undergraduate classroom. What's more, it provides a framework for re-situating them as digital pedagogy, returning agency to the student, and an entirely useful set of criteria for assessing work that does not look like traditional forms. The criteria provided can be transformed into a rubric with two criteria, that the work is 'compelling' and 'effective'.

## Open Notebook History
![img](/img/history-wcalebmcdaniel-wiki-screenshot.png)
+ Artificat Type: blog reflections
+ Source Url: http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html
+ Artefact Permissions: CC BY-SA 3.0
+ Creator and Affiliation: W. Caleb McDaniel
McDaniel opens a dialogue with proponents of so-called 'open notebook science', and situates it within practices familiar to historians (a process similar to what Chad Black has called, ['Hacking the Papers of You'](https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-individual-research-archive-hacking-the-papers-of-you/)). McDaniel argues that we cannot know the full value of what we have until we allow others to see it; if we did so, while the work was in progress, "we also open new avenues of interpretation, uncover new linkages between things we would otherwise have persisted in seeing as unconnected, and create new opportunities for collaboration with fellow travelers." He outlines the use of Gitit, a personal wiki program combined with Git versioning control, for maintaining such a notebook. Gitit has a steep learning curve; others might want to use a combination of text editor ang github repository to achieve the same effect.

## Writing in Public
[Writing in Public, Michelle Moravec](http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/) Michelle's work is a fearless example of putting it all out there, and I direct my students to reflect on this.

## Who do you think you are?
+ It can be dangerous when we break down the walls of our teaching and research, and expose these processes to the wider world. "Who do you think you are?" by Tressie McMillan Cottom http://adanewmedia.org/2015/04/issue7-mcmillancottom/ is required reading. If you don't look like a white man, what can or cannot be done in terms of a public-facing digital pedagogy becomes much more complicated and sometimes dangerous.

## Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology
+ Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology - "Collaboratively produced [...] in the Fall 2014 semester by the students registered in the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt class (ANP 455), the Digital Atlas of Ancient Egypt represents an experiment in applied digital archaeology undergraduate learning." Led by Ethan Watrall. The act of putting this online allows student work to be leveraged by other students, expanded, transmogrified. Christina Ross forked this and repurposed it to become a microhistory of St. John's, Newfoundland http://xtina-r.github.io/daea/, which was then repurposed and extended by Rob Blades (in progress: pembrokesoundscapes.ca). Ross's version is on the syllabus in Jeffery McClurken's 'Adventures in Digital History'. http://courses.mcclurken.org/adh/syllabus/ ).

## The HeritageJam
Andrew Masinton, Sarah Perry, Tara Copplestone, Izzy Bartley http://heritagejam.org. An annual two-day event, having just gone through its second iteration, where participants collaborate to make something along a particular theme, from a particular collection, with a decidedly public-facing inflection. Aside from the wonderful things participants make, the Jam rules require them to document the _paradata_ that supports the work. The paradata document draws on a long history in archaeological research of visualizations and making (there is an entire subfield, 'experimental archaeology', which has strong affinities to digital humanities pedagogy and deformance) as codified in the 2009 London Charter of Heritage Visualization (http://www.londoncharter.org/) . Paradata "provide the space through which we communicate ambiguity and transparency, and account for our practices. In explicitly detailing the creator's process, paradata enable openness, making visible the "relationship between research sources, implicit knowledge, explicit reasoning, and visualisation-based outcomes." This offers viewers an insight into the making process, and an opportunity to think critically about how our images are constructed and create meaning about the past."

## TEI Close Reading Exercise
+ TEI Close Reading exercise by Melodee Beals https://github.com/mhbeals/TEI-Close-Reading demonstrates not just exposing research or teaching to the world, but also builds capacity for the rest of us by sharing the materials.

## Every Three Minutes
+ Every Three Minutes https://twitter.com/every3minutes, associated post, http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/slave-sales-on-twitter.html Caleb McDaniel. Our teaching and research, when freed from the confines of an essay, can become a 'bot of conviction' ([Mark Sample]( https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa#.k7zhd3p6e) that directly confronts the public with the past; the affordances of the medium are used to devastating effect.

## The Programming Historian, issue #152
+ Finally, [The Programming Historian team](http://programminghistorian.org) too, especially this conversation thread, '[how can we make the PH more friendly for women to contribute?'](https://github.com/programminghistorian/jekyll/issues/152). This thread and the thoughtful discussion that surrounds it shows a community of practice around digital pedagogy and capacity building wrestling with an issue in a way that is collegial, humble, and open. At the end of the thread, the discussion will continue with a workshop <https://digitalhistorymentorship.wordpress.com/>.

Digital pedagogy in history changes not just how we teach, but how we _do_, history - how we work on our own, with colleagues, with students, and with the public. All of these pieces are essays in the sense of _essayer_ to try, to experiment, to change the world a little bit.

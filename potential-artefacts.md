# things that have influenced/inspired my pedagogy as a historian

... keeping in mind that I trained as an archaeologist; the training of an archaeologist necessarily includes a lot of hands-on, a lot of 'doing'; what's more, it's often a kind of doing that depends on productive collaboration within a larger team. This is partly what helped to enable my transition into whatever this thing 'digital history' is.

### in no particular order...

1. [social networking platform for students with achievements levels etc](http://neoacademic.com/2010/10/14/call-for-participants-in-nsf-proposal-to-integrate-social-media-in-undergrad-education/) directly inspired early experiments in my class to incorporate gamification elements. Tried this twice. Results were mixed; but it did point to ways of incorporating not traditional ways of learning into my class.
2. [Chad Black's Papers of You](https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-individual-research-archive-hacking-the-papers-of-you/) and ideas concerning open research processes
3. [Open Notebook History](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) Caleb's & Chad's pieces are often cited in my own work: I am directly trying to teach students to be transparent in their research processes. If historians don't start opening up (in the ways, for instance, geaneologists do) we will become irrelevant in the wider discussions of history
4. [Bots of Conviction](https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa#.k7zhd3p6e) by Mark Sample. Algorithmic writing, and thoughts on how we use the affordances of stupid machines to write arresting work
5. [Mark Sample on blogging](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/08/14/pedagogy-and-the-class-blog/) which I think goes hand-in-glove with [what's wrong with writing essays](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/03/12/whats-wrong-with-writing-essays/).
6. which leads naturally to Paul O'Donnell's [the unessay](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay) which I think has great potential for opening the possibility space of historical 'writing' for students. Makes it safe to fail!
7. Kevin Kee's [1812 game](http://ihistorytours.com/). When I was flailing away in the academic wilderness, Kevin hired me to help work with his group on writing history through gaming. I didn't have anything to do with this game, per se, but what it taught Kevin in turned helped influence me. Frankly, without Kevin Kee and John Bonnett, I wouldn't be doing what I do now.
8. John Bonnett was an early leader in writing history through for instance [building models](http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~jbonnett/Syllabus.html) (While archaeologists had long been building 3d models, this was often not something that students themselves were doing. That said, an early piece by Melissa Terras [1999](http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue7/terras/) caught my attention as a grad student! 
9. following along this stream of thought, there was [Okapi Island in Second Life](https://okapi.wordpress.com/projects/okapi-island-in-second-life/) that had a strong impact on me when I was teaching in the trenches of online for-profit education. I even persuaded the liberal arts college start up to buy an island on which to teach archaeology - an event that led to deep friendships with [Eric Kansa](http://alexandriaarchive.org/) and [Colleen Morgan](https://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/) and [Ethan Watrall](http://anthropology.msu.edu/blog/people/ethan-watrall/)

I'm pleased to be curating the keyword 'history' for [keywords in the digital humanities](https://github.com/curateteaching/digitalpedagogy). I've been instructed to select artefacts that highlight the intersection of 'history' with digital pedagogy, its key concepts and practices. I've been approaching this project backwards, first identifying then working backwards from the things that have inspired me to the curatorial statement. Of course, when you read the finished work, you'll encounter my statement first. Just remember, I do most things back to front. Cum grano salis, as they say... 

## things that have influenced/inspired my pedagogy as an historian

... keeping in mind that I trained as an archaeologist; the training of an archaeologist necessarily includes a lot of hands-on, a lot of 'doing'; what's more, it's often a kind of doing that depends on productive collaboration within a larger team. This is partly what helped to enable my transition into whatever this thing 'digital history' is. I often reflect, as I listen to grad students riff on a literature that I have not read (ha, how many of them have read Shanks & Tilley, I ask you), that I'm not much of a historian. No matter; it's what keeps me employed, right? In the instructions for contributors, we were specifically directed to highlight things that do not turn up in the traditional venues (journal articles, books, etc).

### in no particular order...

1. [social networking platform for students with achievements levels etc](http://neoacademic.com/2010/10/14/call-for-participants-in-nsf-proposal-to-integrate-social-media-in-undergrad-education/) directly inspired early experiments in my class to incorporate gamification elements. Tried this twice. Results were mixed; but it did point to ways of incorporating not traditional ways of learning into my class.
2. [Chad Black's Papers of You](https://parezcoydigo.wordpress.com/2010/05/28/the-individual-research-archive-hacking-the-papers-of-you/) and ideas concerning open research processes
3. [Open Notebook History](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) Caleb's & Chad's pieces are often cited in my own work: I am directly trying to teach students to be transparent in their research processes. If historians don't start opening up (in the ways, for instance, geaneologists do) we will become irrelevant in the wider discussions of history
4. [Bots of Conviction](https://medium.com/@samplereality/a-protest-bot-is-a-bot-so-specific-you-cant-mistake-it-for-bullshit-90fe10b7fbaa#.k7zhd3p6e) by Mark Sample. Algorithmic writing, and thoughts on how we use the affordances of stupid machines to write arresting work
5. [Every Three Minutes](https://twitter.com/every3minutes) and [associated post](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/slave-sales-on-twitter.html) also appearing in mainstream media: [piece on same](http://fusion.net/story/28958/this-twitter-bot-is-a-constant-reminder-of-the-brutality-of-slavery/) .
5. [Mark Sample on blogging](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/08/14/pedagogy-and-the-class-blog/) which I think goes hand-in-glove with [what's wrong with writing essays](http://www.samplereality.com/2009/03/12/whats-wrong-with-writing-essays/).
6. which leads naturally to Paul O'Donnell's [the unessay](http://people.uleth.ca/~daniel.odonnell/Teaching/the-unessay) which I think has great potential for opening the possibility space of historical 'writing' for students. Makes it safe to fail!
7. [Two and a half cheers for the lunatics](http://nowviskie.org/2012/lunaticks/) by Bethany Nowviskie - Bethany's impact in DH more generally is so huge, and I've always appreciated her work for how it expands the possibility spaces. That is an incredibly important thing to incorporate into our teaching.
7. Kevin Kee's [1812 game](http://ihistorytours.com/). When I was flailing away in the academic wilderness, Kevin hired me to help work with his group on writing history through gaming. I didn't have anything to do with this game, per se, but what it taught Kevin in turned helped influence me. Frankly, without Kevin Kee and John Bonnett, I wouldn't be doing what I do now.
8. John Bonnett was an early leader in writing history through for instance [building models](http://spartan.ac.brocku.ca/~jbonnett/Syllabus.html) (While archaeologists had long been building 3d models, this was often not something that students themselves were doing. That said, an early piece by Melissa Terras [1999](http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue7/terras/) caught my attention as a grad student! 
9. following along this stream of thought, there was [Okapi Island in Second Life](https://okapi.wordpress.com/projects/okapi-island-in-second-life/) that had a strong impact on me when I was teaching in the trenches of online for-profit education. I even persuaded the liberal arts college start up to buy an island on which to teach archaeology - an event that led (via blogging in public my successes and failures) to deep friendships with [Eric Kansa](http://alexandriaarchive.org/) and [Colleen Morgan](https://middlesavagery.wordpress.com/) and [Ethan Watrall](http://anthropology.msu.edu/blog/people/ethan-watrall/)
10. [The action figure curriculum](http://www.robmacdougall.org/blog/2010/05/the-action-figure-curriculum/) Rob MacDougall's consistently playful engagement with the past, whether action figures or [ARGs]( http://www.robmacdougall.org/tecumseh-lies-here/) (sadly, the tecumsehlieshere.org site has been purchased by Japanese spambots), has been a strong influence
11. [Bill Turkel's A Workflow for Digital Research Using Off-the-Shelf Tools](http://williamjturkel.net/how-to/) 
12. [ORBIS|Via](http://orbis.stanford.edu/via/#) a playful interface for exploring a serious tool.
13. [Ancient Lives](http://www.ancientlives.org/) crowdsourcing & public engagement; [Transcribe Bentham](http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/) of course is enormously influential here
14. [Scholarslab](http://scholarslab.org/) and the [Roy Rosenzweig Centre for History and New Media](https://chnm.gmu.edu/) of course, just by existing, give that institutional gravity that digital historians of all stripes can draw on as they navigate the administrivia of their own institutions.
15. [Domain of One's Own](http://umw.domains/about/) began as a project out of the history department at the University of Mary Washington. The impact of this project can't be understated - especially when we also make this intersect with the other trends on this list of mine.
16. [Jack Doughtery & Kristen Nawrotzki]( http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/dh/12230987.0001.001/1:10/--writing-history-in-the-digital-age?g=dculture;rgn=div1;view=fulltext;xc=1#10.3) I've been priveleged to participate in two open writing, open peer review projects conceived and guided by Jack & Kristen. The impact of these experiences... well, [the macroscope](http://themacroscope.org) and [the workbook](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca)
17. [Writing in Public, Michelle Moravec](http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/) Michelle's work is a fearless example of putting it all out there, and I direct my students to reflect on this.
17. [Mining the Dispatch](http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/) There's still no better site for demonstrating the potential of digital methods on vast corpora of unstructured historical texts than Rob Nelson's Mining the Dispatch. What's more, Rob's generosity in helping me understand how MALLET works (or rather, can be made to work) led to our piece in the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet)
18. [Digital History Methods class final project](http://ricedh.github.io/) is a beautiful class project, from Caleb McDaniel's [class](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu/)
19. [Miriam Posner's students' class project, New Jersey Shipwrecks](http://njshipwrecks.com/) is another beautiful project - and the sheer fun the students had whilst making it shines clearly through.
20. [Miriam's how did they make that?](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/) and [Tiffany Chan's version for undergraduate digital history](http://slides.com/tiffchan/hdtmt#/)
20. Speaking of fun, [Operation Lapis](http://www.practomime.com/lapis/lapis.php) is one of the best examples of game-based pedagogy applied to teaching, that spools out over two years(!).
21. [Play the past](http://playthepast.org) while this project has slipped into somnessence, it is still one of the best and thoughtful places discussing the intersection of history (writ large) & games (writ larger) on the web, and the vast collection of work here continues to inspire and motivate me. [Read Rebecca Mir](http://www.playthepast.org/?author_name=mir), and also Angela Cox's series on [teaching games as texts](http://www.playthepast.org/?author_name=cox)
22. The [digital atlas of egyptian archaeology](http://matrix-msu.github.io/daea/) was a class project at MSU led by Ethan Watrall. The code that that class developed was forked by one of my students, Christina Ross and repurposed for a [micro-history of St. John's](http://xtina-r.github.io/daea/projects.html). In turn, Christina's project has turned up on Jeff McClurken's [syllabus for adventures in digital history](http://courses.mcclurken.org/adh/syllabus/) (and has also inspired one of my MA students, who forked it again and has added lots of additional functionality, including sound. But I won't share that piece here because it's not done yet). That whole trail I'd like to nominate as an artefact. I wonder if I'm allowed.

Well, that's all that springs to mind. I need to whittle this down to 10. Implicit through all of this is my 'curatorial statement', which is currently still on my machine but will appear in this repo in due course. 

Feedback appreciateed; you can click on 'issues' for this repo to leave me a note.

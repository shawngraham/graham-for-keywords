# Curatorial Statement, 'history', keywords in digital humanities pedagogy

_just thinking out loud here_

The status quo signifier for historical seriousness, for scholarship, is the essay (cf b&m 2015, p39). Digital work disrupts this form. Work that transgresses this 'compulsory figure' (O'Donnell, 2012) is only slowly being recognized (Gibbs 2016; Robertson 2016; but see also the posts by Sheila Brennan listed below on reviews of digital work in academic scholarship). As scholarship informs teaching, this is what makes the difference between 'digital pedagogy' and 'online learning'. Digital pedagogy cannot easily be fit inside the 'systems' that 'manage' our 'learning'. 'Online education' is about the 'compulsory figures' of academia, of recreating a controllable, observable 'classroom' through a system that watches and monitors everything.  Compulsory figures lend themselves well to instrumentalization. If we think of 'being a student' as a kind of game with a clear end goal in mind (credentials), then merely complete the compulsory figures to win. Thus another important difference is that a digital pedagogy (however instantiated) pushes beyond compulsory figures, whilst 'online learning' reinforces them.  The essay looms large in the minds of our students as the thing above all else that historians _do_. "How many pages? How many words? How many sources?" If it isn't an essay, students balk, students resist. They know the game.

Here, I have selected artefacts that plot a way forward for expanding the realm of the possible, for showing how an expanded universe of historical 'writing' can be folded into one's digital pedagogy in a way that transgresses the replicated-classroom model of online education. In terms of online education, essays become easy to track, easy to 'turn it in'. The essay, as a product measured within online learning systems promotes atomization and rote hoop-jumping; this in turn enables surveillance, tracking (sorry, 'engagement analytics'), and habituation to the same as a norm. Our pedagogy should aspire to more than this.

Therefore, my vision of what 'history' means as a keyword in digital pedagogy is that it (this vision) could enable a return to the _spirit_ of the essay ('_essayer_, to try') if we remember that one of its (the essay's) early purposes was to communicate to a wider public. To write an essay was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are here: that is, a simulation. Simulations and games, playful experiences, in public: digital pedagogy in history expands and reinvents the essay in a form fitting for the age. 

The artefacts collected below represent key moments/movements/examples that establish ways for us to employ this vision of a digital pedagogy of history, whether that teaching takes place in a classroom or in public, online or off. Many universities have a course called 'the Historian's craft' or something similar on the catalogue: so let us stop writing and start crafting. A digital pedagogy is a pedagogy of making, a pedagogy of playing to see what happens next, whether the resulting object is digital or analogue. Digital; digits; fingers; play.

The artefacts below are arranged in an order that should facilitate the integration of digital pedagogies into one's teaching and research.

My thanks to Ian Milligan for perceptive comments as I wrote this, and to Rebecca Frost Davis for inviting me to contribute, and for many fruitful and stimulating conversations!

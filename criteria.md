# Criteria

In the instructions I received, I am told:

> The curatorial statement expresses your vision of the keyword â€” what it means in a pedagogical context and how you approached the task of curating pedagogical artifacts around it. Statements can include some or all of the following:

> Vision statement (how do you envision or understand this keyword and its relation to pedagogy?)
> Scholarly rationale for selections
> Criteria for selections (why were the specific curated artifacts selected?)
> Important issues (why teach this now? why does this topic matter for students? for faculty? for a field? what makes this keyword unique or exemplary for digital pedagogy?)
> Particular intersections with your pedagogical philosophy/teaching conditions (how and where do you teach issues related to this keyword? in what course(s)? with what learning expectations/outcomes in mind? with or without what resources? what are your students' backgrounds, interests, or investments?)
> Unless it draws upon your first-person experience in the classroom, please limit the use of first person.

# Curatorial Statement, history , keywords in digital humanities pedagogy

_just thinking out loud here_

The essay looms large in the minds of our students as the thing above all else that historians _do_. "How many pages? How many words? How many sources?" They know the game. If it isn an essay, students balk, students resist. With good reason, for the status quo signifier for historical seriousness, for scholarship, is indeed the essay (and its longer cousin, the monograph)(cf b&m 2015, p39). Digital work that transgresses this 'compulsory figure' (O'Donnell, 2012) is only slowly being recognized (Gibbs 2016; Robertson 2016; but see also the posts by Sheila Brennan listed below on reviews of digital work in academic scholarship). Since how we practice our scholarship informs our teaching, this transgression is what marks the difference between digital pedagogy and online learning.  Online education is about the compulsory figures of academia, of recreating a controllable, observable classroom through a system that watches and monitors everything.  Essays are easy to track, easy to turn-it-in. Compulsory figures lend themselves well to instrumentalization. If we think of being a student as a kind of game with a clear end goal in mind (credentialism), then merely complete the compulsory figures to win.

 Digital pedagogy by its transgressive nature cannot easily fit inside the systems that manage our learning. A digital pedagogy (however instantiated) pushes beyond compulsory figures and breaks the game, whilst online learning merely reinforces them. Students will understandably resist. But we must make the case, otherwise we risk undermining the very project of the university.

Here, I have selected artifacts that plot a way forward for expanding the realm of the possible, for showing how an expanded universe of historical writing can be folded into one's digital pedagogy in a way that transgresses the replicated-classroom model of online education.  My vision of what history means as a keyword in digital pedagogy is to remember what the _spirit_ of the essay ( _essayer_, to try) entails. It was a public exercise, a kind of dialogue. To write an essay was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are here: that is, a simulation. Simulations and games, playful experiences, in public: digital pedagogy in history expands and reinvents the essay in a form fitting for the age. Indeed, this vision is very public facing and helps to turn our teaching inside-out; the teaching of history becomes a kind of public history in this model.

The artefacts collected below [right now, [over here](https://github.com/shawngraham/graham-for-keywords/blob/master/short-list-artefacts.md)] represent key moments/movements/examples that lay a pathway for us to employ this vision of a digital pedagogy of history, whether that teaching takes place in a classroom or in public, online or off. Many universities have a course called the Historian s craft or something similar on the catalogue: so let us stop writing and start crafting. A digital pedagogy is a pedagogy of making, a pedagogy of playing to see what happens next, whether the resulting object is digital or analogue. Digital; digits; fingers; play.

The artefacts below are arranged in an order that should facilitate the integration of digital pedagogies into one's teaching and research.

My thanks to Ian Milligan for perceptive comments as I wrote this, and to Rebecca Frost Davis for inviting me to contribute, and for many fruitful and stimulating conversations!

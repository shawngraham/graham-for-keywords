# Curatorial Statement, 'history', keywords in digital humanities pedagogy

_just thinking out loud here_

Is there a material difference between 'digital pedagogy' and 'online learning'? If we think of 'being a student' as a kind of game with a clear end goal in mind (credentials), then one difference is that the former breaks us out of conventions, whilst the other reinforces them. 'Online education' is about recreating a controllable, observable 'classroom' through a system that watches and observes everything. Digital pedagogy cannot easily be fit inside the 'systems' that 'manage' our 'learning'. Similarly, in the game of 'being an academic historian', the focus on the monograph and the article as the so-called 'coin of the realm' (b&m 2015, p39) reinforces the existing status quo, while work that transgresses these norms does not fit, and is only slowly being recognized (Gibbs 2016; Robertson 2016) despite twenty years or more of work. 

**Ian comment: I'm still not sure about the essay being dead. A few more sentences will be necessary to make that argument and make the rest flow...**

**shawn thought:  i guess what I'm pushing against here is the fetishization of the essay as the thing that historians do, per students. Or at least, my students. so not so much that the essay is the problem, but rather, the way it seems to loom large in the minds of students as the sine qua non of being an historian - or at least, a history student **

The status quo signifier for historical seriousness, for scholarship, is the essay. But, the essay is dead. We have killed it. What joy, what experimentation, what it might actually mean 'to try' something - that is, the French _essayer_ -  has been hammered out of our lives. These things don't fit within the game. Instead, we keep a careful eye on the teacher/peer's expectations, and we end up writing something very safe, very narrow, very much for an audience of one. That is not to say that the essay as a form is not capable of being used in novel, intriguing, or suprising ways. But in terms of online education, essays become easy to track, easy to 'turn it in'. The essay, as a product measured within online learning systems promotes atomization and rote hoop-jumping; this in turn enables surveillance, tracking (sorry, 'engagement analytics'), and habituation to the same as a norm. Our pedagogy should aspire to more than this.

Therefore, my vision of what 'history' means as a keyword in digital pedagogy is that it (this vision) could enable a return to the _spirit_ of the essay if we remember that one of its (the essay's) early purposes was to communicate to a wider public. To write an essay was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are here: that is, a simulation. Simulations and games, playful experiences, in public: digital pedagogy in history expands and reinvents the essay in a form fitting for the age. 

The artefacts collected below thus represent key moments/movements/examples that establish ways for us to employ this vision of the digital pedagogy of history, whether that teaching takes place in a classroom or in public, online or off. Many universities have a course called 'the Historian's craft' or something similar on the catalogue: so let us stop writing and start crafting. A digital pedagogy is a pedagogy of making, whether the resulting object is digital or analogue. Digital; digits; fingers; play.

The artefacts below are arranged in an order that should facilitate the integration of digital pedagogies into one's teaching and research.

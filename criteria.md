# Curatorial Statement, 'history', keywords in digital humanities pedagogy

_just thinking out loud here_

Is there a material difference between 'digital pedagogy' and 'online learning'? If we think of 'being a student' as a kind of game with a clear end goal in mind (credentials), then one difference is that the former breaks us out of conventions, whilst the other reinforces them. 'Online education' is about recreating a controllable, observable 'classroom' through a system that watches and observes everything. Digital pedagogy cannot easily be fit inside the 'systems' that 'manage' our 'learning'. Similarly, in the game of 'being an academic historian', the focus on the monograph and the article as the so-called 'coin of the realm' (b&m 2015, p39) reinforces the existing status quo, while work that transgresses these norms does not fit, and is only slowly being recognized (Gibbs 2016; Robertson 2016) despite twenty years or more of work. 

The status quo signifier for historical seriousness, for scholarship, is the essay. But, the essay is dead. We have killed it. What joy, what experimentation, what it might actually mean 'to try' something - that is, _essayer_ -  has been hammered out of our lives. These things don't fit within the game. Instead, we keep a careful eye on the teacher/peer's expectations, and we end up writing something very safe, very narrow, very much for an audience of one. That is not to say that the essay as a form is not capable of being used in novel, intriguing, or suprising ways. But in terms of online education, essays become easy to track, easy to 'turn it in'. The atomization that the essay as a tool of online education promotes, in turn enables surveillance, tracking, and habituation to the same as a norm. This should be resisted.

Therefore, my vision of what 'history' means as a keyword in digital pedagogy is that it (this vision) could enable a return to the _spirit_ of the essay if we remember that one of its (the essay's) early purposes was to communicate to a wider public. To write an essay was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are here: that is, a simulation. The written essay was an excellent tool for building worlds in other people's minds, but I think that is no longer the case if we limit our understand of _essayer_ to the kinds of work we habitually ask our students to write. 

The artefacts collected below thus represent key moments/movements that establish ways for us to break out of these historical games in the digital pedagogy of history, whether that teaching takes place in a classroom or in public, online or off. Every university has a course called 'the Historian's craft' on the catalogue: so let us stop writing and start crafting. A digital pedagogy is a pedagogy of making, whether the resulting object is digital or analogue. Digital; digits; fingers; play.

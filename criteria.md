# Criteria

In the instructions I received, I am told:

> The curatorial statement expresses your vision of the keyword â€” what it means in a pedagogical context and how you approached the task of curating pedagogical artifacts around it. Statements can include some or all of the following:

> Vision statement (how do you envision or understand this keyword and its relation to pedagogy?)
> Scholarly rationale for selections
> Criteria for selections (why were the specific curated artifacts selected?)
> Important issues (why teach this now? why does this topic matter for students? for faculty? for a field? what makes this keyword unique or exemplary for digital pedagogy?)
> Particular intersections with your pedagogical philosophy/teaching conditions (how and where do you teach issues related to this keyword? in what course(s)? with what learning expectations/outcomes in mind? with or without what resources? what are your students' backgrounds, interests, or investments?)
> Unless it draws upon your first-person experience in the classroom, please limit the use of first person.


Is there a material difference between 'digital pedagogy' and 'online learning'? If we think of 'being a student' as a kind of game with a clear end goal in mind (credentials), then one clear difference is that the former breaks us out of conventions, whilst the other reinforces them. Similarly, in the game of 'being an academic historian', the focus on the monograph and the article as the so-called 'coin of the realm' (b&m 2015, p39) similarly reinforces the existing status quo, while work that transgresses these norms is only slowly being recognized (Gibbs 2016; Robertson 2016). 

The status quo signifier for historical seriousness, for scholarship, is the essay. But, the essay is dead. We have killed it. What joy, what experimentation, what it might actually mean 'to try' something - that is, _essayer_ -  has been hammered out of our lives. These things don't fit within the game. Instead, we keep a careful eye on the teacher/peer's expectations, and we end up writing something very safe, very narrow, very much for an audience of one. That is not to say that the essay as a form is not capable of being used in novel, intriguing, or suprising ways. But in terms of online education, essays become easy to track, easy to 'turn it in'. The atomization that the essay as a tool of online education promotes, in turn enables surveillance, tracking, and 

Therefore, my vision of what 'history' means as a keyword in digital pedagogy is that it could enable a return to the _spirit_ of the essay if we remember that one of its early purposes was to communicate to a wider public; that it was to sketch out an experience, an argument, a world where things might be different than they are here: that is, a simulation. The written essay was an excellent tool for building worlds in other people's minds, but I think that is no longer the case.

The artefacts collected below thus represent key moments/movements that establish ways for us to break out of these historical games in the digital pedagogy of history, whether that teaching takes place in a classroom or in public, online or off.
